## Time Series Analysis

A *time series* is any data collected over a period of time. Examples are

-  Dow Jones Industrial index  
-  Population of Earth  
-  Number of AIDS patients at some hospital 
-  ...

The main feature that sets time series apart is that the assumption of independence usually fails. If I wanted to guess the size of the human population in 2019, knowing  what it is in 2018 might be useful.

#### **Example**: Births in New York

data set of the number of births per month in New York city, from January 1946 to December 1959 (originally collected by Newton)

```{r echo=FALSE}
births <-
c(26.663, 23.598, 26.931, 24.74, 25.806, 24.364, 24.477, 23.901, 
23.175, 23.227, 21.672, 21.87, 21.439, 21.089, 23.709, 21.669, 
21.752, 20.761, 23.479, 23.824, 23.105, 23.11, 21.759, 22.073, 
21.937, 20.035, 23.59, 21.672, 22.222, 22.123, 23.95, 23.504, 
22.238, 23.142, 21.059, 21.573, 21.548, 20, 22.424, 20.615, 21.761, 
22.874, 24.104, 23.748, 23.262, 22.907, 21.519, 22.025, 22.604, 
20.894, 24.677, 23.673, 25.32, 23.583, 24.671, 24.454, 24.122, 
24.252, 22.084, 22.991, 23.287, 23.049, 25.076, 24.037, 24.43, 
24.667, 26.451, 25.618, 25.014, 25.11, 22.964, 23.981, 23.798, 
22.27, 24.775, 22.646, 23.988, 24.737, 26.276, 25.816, 25.21, 
25.199, 23.162, 24.707, 24.364, 22.644, 25.565, 24.062, 25.431, 
24.635, 27.009, 26.606, 26.268, 26.462, 25.246, 25.18, 24.657, 
23.304, 26.982, 26.199, 27.21, 26.122, 26.706, 26.878, 26.152, 
26.379, 24.712, 25.688, 24.99, 24.239, 26.721, 23.475, 24.767, 
26.219, 28.361, 28.599, 27.914, 27.784, 25.693, 26.881, 26.217, 
24.218, 27.914, 26.975, 28.527, 27.139, 28.982, 28.169, 28.056, 
29.136, 26.291, 26.987, 26.589, 24.848, 27.543, 26.896, 28.878, 
27.39, 28.065, 28.141, 29.048, 28.484, 26.634, 27.735, 27.132, 
24.924, 28.963, 26.589, 27.931, 28.009, 29.229, 28.759, 28.405, 
27.945, 25.912, 26.619, 26.076, 25.286, 27.66, 25.951, 26.398, 
25.565, 28.865, 30, 29.261, 29.012, 26.992, 27.897)
births <- births*1000
```

the first step is to store the data in a time series object in R, so that we can use Râ€™s many functions for analysing time series data. One way to do that is the base R function *ts*.

by default ts assumes equal space time units of one year. For other time spans we can use the argument *frequency*. For example, if data is by month, use frequency=12. We can also change the starting point:

```{r}
birth.ts <- ts(births, frequency=12, start=c(1946, 1))
head(birth.ts)
```

#### **Example**: Deaths in Puerto Rico

number of deaths per month in Puerto Rico, according to the official deaths statistics of the government:

![](deaths.maria.png)

```{r}
Deaths <- c(2744, 2403, 2427, 2259, 2340, 2145, 
            2382, 2272, 2258, 2393, 2268, 2516,
            2742, 2592, 2458, 2241, 2312, 2355,
            2456, 2427, 2367, 2357, 2484, 2854,
            2894, 2315, 2494, 2392, 2390, 2369, 
            2367, 2321, 2928, 3040, 2671, 2820,
            2821, 2448, 2643, 2218)
pr.deaths.ts <-  ts(Deaths, frequency=12, 
                    start=c(2015, 1))
```

#### **Example**: Dow Jones Industrial index

Data set has the daily closing values of the Dow Jones Industrial Index from January 2000 to November 2018 and the weekly closing values from January 1985 to November 2018.

the data set is available at [dow.jones.rds](http://academic.uprm.edu/wrolke/esma6836/dow.jones.rds)


```{r}
dow.jones <- readRDS("C:\\Users\\Wolfgang\\Dropbox\\teaching\\Computational-Statistics-with-R\\dow.jones.rds")
head(dow.jones$Weekly)
```

Again we want to turn this into a time series  object. Here however we have the problem that the time variable is not equal spaced (sometimes the New York stock exchange is not open on a Monday or a Friday). One way to do this is to use the package *zoo*:


```{r}
library(zoo)
dj.ts <- zoo(dow.jones$Weekly$Close,
     order.by=as.Date(as.character(dow.jones$Weekly$Date)))
```


### Graphs

There is an obvious graph for a time series, namely a line graph by time. A ts object already has a plot function, so

#### **Example**: Births in New York

```{r}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(birth.ts)
```

#### **Example**: Deaths in Puerto Rico

```{r}
autoplot(pr.deaths.ts)
```

here we have a strong seasonal trend, deaths go up a lot in the winter. And of course we have a spike around September 2017!

#### **Example**: Dow Jones

```{r}
autoplot(dj.ts)
```


`r hl()$hr()`

### Decomposition

In general a time series consists of some (or all) of these parts:

-  a baseline  
-  a trend  
-  seasonal component(s) 
-  unusual parts  
-  random fluctuation

#### **Example**: Deaths in Puerto Rico

here we seem to have all of these:

-  a baseline: roughly 2300 deaths per month   
-  a trend: from around 2250 in 2015 to 2500 in 2018  
-  seasonal component: winter month vs rest of year   
-  unusual parts: September 2017

One of the tasks in a time series analysis is to *decompose* the series into these parts.

#### **Example**: Births

```{r}
births.dec <- decompose(birth.ts)
plot(births.dec)
```

so we see a clear trend and seasonal component

#### **Example**: Deaths in PR

an alternative to decompose is the *stl* routine, which uses *loess* to do the fitting: 

```{r}
pr.deaths.dec <- stl(pr.deaths.ts, "periodic")
plot(pr.deaths.dec)
```

again a clear trend and seasonal component.

#### **Example**: Dow Jones

```{r error=TRUE}
dj.dec <- stl(dj.ts, "periodic")
```

and this gives an error. That is because this time series has irregular time points. It can be quite a chore to "fix" this problem. If the time periods are somewhat regular (in our case they are almost one week) it is easier to make a new series with a reguler time scale:

```{r}
dj.alt.ts <- ts(dow.jones$Weekly$Close, frequency = 52,
                start=c(1985, 1))
dj.alt.dec <- stl(dj.alt.ts, "periodic")
plot(dj.alt.dec)
```

which shows a clear trend but not any seasonality. We also see that the variation is increasing over time.

### ARIMA models

As we said before, the special feature of a time series is a dependence between neighboring points. This suggests a way to analyse a time series by analysing the correlation between time points.

#### **Example**: Births

Let's define a new variable: $Y_i=X_i-X_{i-1}$, that is the change in the number of births from one month to the next.

```{r}
y <- diff(births)
plot(y)
```

here we now longer have any pattern, which shows us that this series consisted only of a trend (which we eliminted in y).

There are some R routines to do this for us for a time series:

#### **Example**: PR Deaths

```{r}
acf(pr.deaths.ts)
```

which shows a clear seasonal pattern.

`r hl()$hr()`

the above is an example of a general model for time series called *ARIMA* (auto-regressive integrated moving average).

Here are a couple of examples:

-  AR(1) = ARIMA(1, 0, 0)

$$
X_i=c+\alpha_1 X_{i-1} +\epsilon_i
$$

for the births data we saw that $X_i-X_{i-1}$ was essentially random noise, so it seems that series can be modeled as an AR(1).

-  AR(2) = ARIMA(2, 0, 0)

$$
X_i=c+\alpha_1 X_{i-1}+ \alpha_2 X_{i-2} +\epsilon_i
$$
-  MA(1)=AR(0, 0, 1)

$$
X_i=c+\beta_1 \epsilon_{i-1} + \epsilon_i
$$

finally ARIMA combines both variations.

#### **Example**: Simulated data

let's create some artifical data to see what is going on:

```{r}
eps <- rnorm(100)
x <- sort(runif(100, 1, 10))
x.ar <- ts(5 +  x[-1] + 0.2* x[-100] + eps[-100])
plot(x.ar)
acf(x.ar)
x.ma <- ts(5 + 2* eps[-1] + eps[-100]) 
plot(x.ma)
acf(x.ma)
```

so the acf plot of x.ma shows us that indeed we have a moving average process, with a lag of 1 or 2.

Fitting an ARIMA model can be done with the *auto.arima* routine from the *forcast* package:

```{r}
library(forecast)
auto.arima(x.ar)
```

### Spectral Analysis

The most general way to analyse a time series is a *spectral analysis*. In essence, we assume that 

$$
X_t=\sum_{j=1}^k \left(A_j \sin(2 \pi \nu_j t) +B_j \cos(2 \pi \nu_j t)  \right)
$$
and a spectral analysis amounts to estimating the parameters $A_j, B_j, \nu_j$.

A fuller discussion of this is beyond our course. It would require first a discussion *Fourier analysis*, one of the most widely used technics in mathematics and enginering. 

The usual starting point is a look at the *periodogram*

#### **Example**: Births

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
spec.pgram(birth.ts, spans = c(3, 3))
spec.pgram(birth.ts, spans = c(3, 5))
spec.pgram(birth.ts, spans = c(7, 11))
spec.pgram(birth.ts, spans = c(7, 21))
```

and so we see that larger values of span do more smoothing and show the underlying patters

#### **Example**: PR Deaths

```{r}
spec.pgram(pr.deaths.ts, span= c(3, 3))
```

#### **Example**: Dow Jones

```{r}
spec.pgram(dj.alt.ts, span= c(3, 9))
```

and as we know there is no seasonal component here.
